----------------------------
This repository is the **reference implementation** of
[The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.github.io/).
It is written in Python and intended to conform to version 1.0 of the
[TUF specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md).
This implementation is in use in production systems, but is also intended to be
a readable guide and demonstration for those working on implementing TUF in
their own languages, environments, or update systems.


About The Update Framework
--------------------------
The Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security of a
software update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository
or signing keys.
TUF provides a flexible
[specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md)
defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or
re-implement to fit their needs.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as
part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF)
and its design is [used in production](docs/ADOPTERS.md) by companies such as Cloudflare,
Datadog, DigitalOcean, Docker, Flynn, IBM, Kolide, LEAP, Microsoft, RedHat,
and VMware. A variant of TUF called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is
widely used to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles.

Please see the [TUF Introduction](docs/OVERVIEW.rst) and
[TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about TUF!

Contact
-------
Please contact us via our [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework).
Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed on this low volume mailing
list.

We strive to make the specification easy to implement, so if you come across
any inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let us know by sending an
email, or by reporting an issue in the GitHub [specification
repo](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues).

Security Issues and Bugs
------------------------

Security issues can be reported by emailing jcappos@nyu.edu.

At a minimum, the report must contain the following:

* Description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.

Optionally, reports that are emailed can be encrypted with PGP.  You should use
PGP key fingerprint **E9C0 59EC 0D32 64FA B35F  94AD 465B F9F6 F8EB 475A**.

Please do not use the GitHub issue tracker to submit vulnerability reports.
The issue tracker is intended for bug reports and to make feature requests.
Major feature requests, such as design changes to the specification, should
be proposed via a [TUF Augmentation Proposal](docs/TAP.rst) (TAP).
