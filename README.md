## Introduction

The Update Framework (TUF) is a framework for secure content delivery and updates. It protects against various types of supply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. This repository is a **reference implementation** written in Python. It is intended to conform to version 1.0 of the [TUF specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/).

Python-TUF provides the following APIs:
  
- [`tuf.api.metadata`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html): A "low-level" API designed to provide easy and safe access to TUF metadata and to handle (de)serialization from/to files.
  
- [`tuf.ngclient`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html): A client implementation built on top of the metadata API.
  
- `tuf.repository`: A repository library also built on top of the metadata API. This module is currently not considered part of python-tuf stable API.

The reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstration for those working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, or update systems.

## About The Update Framework

The Update Framework (TUF) is a design that helps developers maintain the security of a software update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository or signing keys. TUF provides a flexible specification defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or re-implement to fit their needs.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) and is utilized in production by various tech companies and open-source organizations. A variant of TUF called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles.

For more information about TUF, visit [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/).

## Key Features

- **Robust Security**: TUF ensures the security of software update systems, even in the face of compromise or supply chain attacks. It employs a variety of cryptographic techniques to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of software updates.
- **Flexible Specification**: TUF provides a flexible specification that developers can adapt to fit their specific software update system requirements. This allows for easy integration into existing systems and promotes interoperability.
- **Production Usage**: TUF is utilized in production by various tech companies and open-source organizations, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
- **Variant Support**: TUF's variant, Uptane, is specifically designed to secure over-the-air updates in automobiles, showcasing its versatility and applicability across different domains.
