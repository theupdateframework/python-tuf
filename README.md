----------------------------
[The Update Framework (TUF)](https://theupdateframework.io/) is a framework for
secure content delivery and updates. It protects against various types of
supply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. This repository is a
**reference implementation** written in Python. It is intended to conform to
version 1.0 of the [TUF
specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/).

Python-TUF provides two APIs:
  * [`tuf.api.metadata`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html),
    a "low-level" API, designed to provide easy and safe access to TUF
    metadata and to handle (de)serialization from/to files.
  * [`tuf.ngclient`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html),
    a client implementation built on top of the metadata API.

High-level support for implementing
[repository operations](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/#repository-operations)
is planned but not yet provided: see [ADR 10](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/docs/adr/0010-repository-library-design.md).

The reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstration
for those working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, or
update systems.


About The Update Framework
--------------------------
The Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security of a
software update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository
or signing keys.
TUF provides a flexible
[specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md)
defining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or
re-implement to fit their needs.

TUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as
part of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF)
and its design is [used in production](https://theupdateframework.io/adoptions/)
by various tech companies and open source organizations. A variant of TUF
called [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-air
updates in automobiles.

Please see [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about TUF!
