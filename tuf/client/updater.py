<Purpose>
  'updater.py' is intended to be the only TUF module that software update
  systems need to utilize.  It provides a single class representing an
  updater that includes methods to download, install, and verify
  metadata/target files in a secure manner.  Importing 'updater.py' and
  instantiating its main class is all that is required by the client prior
  to a TUF update request.  The importation and instantiation steps allow
  TUF to load all of the required metadata files and set the repository mirror
  information.

  An overview of the update process:

  1. The software update system instructs TUF to check for updates.

  2. TUF downloads and verifies timestamp.txt.

  3. If timestamp.txt indicates that release.txt has changed, TUF downloads and
  verifies release.txt.

  4. TUF determines which metadata files listed in release.txt differ from those
  described in the last release.txt that TUF has seen.  If root.txt has changed,
  the update process starts over using the new root.txt.

  5. TUF provides the software update system with a list of available files
  according to targets.txt.

  6. The software update system instructs TUF to download a specific target
  file.

  7. TUF downloads and verifies the file and then makes the file available to
  the software update system.

<Example Client>

  # The client first imports the 'updater.py' module, the only module the
  # client is required to import.  The client will utilize a single class
  # from this module.
  import tuf.client.updater

  # The only other module the client interacts with is 'tuf.conf'.  The
  # client accesses this module solely to set the repository directory.
  # This directory will hold the files downloaded from a remote repository.
  tuf.conf.repository_directory = 'local-repository'
 
  # Next, the client creates a dictionary object containing the repository
  # mirrors.  The client may download content from any one of these mirrors.
  # In the example below, a single mirror named 'mirror1' is defined.  The
  # mirror is located at 'http://localhost:8001', and all of the metadata
  # and targets files can be found in the 'metadata' and 'targets' directory,
  # respectively.  If the client wishes to only download target files from
  # specific directories on the mirror, the 'confined_target_dirs' field
  # should be set.  In the example, the client has chosen '', which is
  # interpreted as no confinement.  In other words, the client can download
  # targets from any directory or subdirectories.  If the client had chosen
  # 'targets1/', they would have been confined to the '/targets/targets1/'
  # directory on the 'http://localhost:8001' mirror. 
  repository_mirrors = {'mirror1': {'url_prefix': 'http://localhost:8001',
                                    'metadata_path': 'metadata',
                                    'targets_path': 'targets',
                                    'confined_target_dirs': ['']}}

  # The updater may now be instantiated.  The Updater class of 'updater.py'
  # is called with two arguments.  The first argument assigns a name to this
  # particular updater and the second argument the repository mirrors defined
  # above.
  updater = tuf.client.updater.Updater('updater', repository_mirrors)

  # The client next calls the refresh() method to ensure it has the latest
  # copies of the metadata files.
  updater.refresh()

  # The target file information for all the repository targets is determined.
  targets = updater.all_targets()
  
  # Among these targets, determine the ones that have changed since the client's
  # last refresh().  A target is considered updated if it does not exist in
  # 'destination_directory' (current directory) or the target located there has
  # changed.
  destination_directory = '.'
  updated_targets = updater.updated_targets(targets, destination_directory)

  # Lastly, attempt to download each target among those that have changed.
  # The updated target files are saved locally to 'destination_directory'.
  for target in updated_targets:
    updater.download_target(target, destination_directory)

class Updater(object):
  """
  <Purpose>
    Provide a class that can download target files securely.  The updater
    keeps track of currently and previously trusted metadata, target files
    available to the client, target file attributes such as file size and 
    hashes, key and role information, metadata signatures, and the ability
    to determine when the download of a file should be permitted.

  <Updater Attributes>
    self.metadata:
      Dictionary holding the currently and previously trusted metadata.
      Example: {'current': {'root': ROOTROLE_SCHEMA,
                            'targets':TARGETSROLE_SCHEMA, ...},
                'previous': {'root': ROOTROLE_SCHEMA,
                             'targets':TARGETSROLE_SCHEMA, ...}}
    
    self.metadata_directory:
      The directory where trusted metadata is stored.
      
    self.fileinfo:
      A cache of lengths and hashes of stored metadata files.
      Example: {'root.txt': {'length': 13323,
                             'hashes': {'sha256': dbfac345..}},
                ...}

    self.mirrors:
      The repository mirrors from which metadata and targets are available.
      Conformant to 'tuf.formats.MIRRORDICT_SCHEMA'.
    
    self.name:
      The name of the updater instance.
 
  <Updater Methods>
    refresh():
      This method downloads, verifies, and loads metadata for the top-level
      roles in a specific order (i.e., timestamp -> release -> root -> targets)
      The expiration time for downloaded metadata is also verified.
      
      The metadata for delegated roles are not refreshed by this method, but by
      the target methods (e.g., all_targets(), targets_of_role(), target()).
      The refresh() method should be called by the client before any target
      requests.
    
    all_targets():
      Returns the target information for the 'targets' and delegated roles.
      Prior to extracting the target information, this method attempts a file
      download of all the target metadata that have changed.
    
    targets_of_role('targets'):
      Returns the target information for the targets of a specified role.
      Like all_targets(), delegated metadata is updated if it has changed.
    
    target(file_path):
      Returns the target information for a specific file identified by its file
      path.  This target method also downloads the metadata of updated targets.
    
    updated_targets(targets, destination_directory):
      After the client has retrieved the target information for those targets
      they are interested in updating, they would call this method to determine
      which targets have changed from those saved locally on disk.  All the
      targets that have changed are returns in a list.  From this list, they
      can request a download by calling 'download_target()'.
    
    download_target(target, destination_directory):
      This method performs the actual download of the specified target.  The
      file is saved to the 'destination_directory' argument.

    remove_obsolete_targets(destination_directory):
      Any files located in 'destination_directory' that were previously
      served by the repository but have since been removed, can be deleted
      from disk by the client by calling this method.

  """

  def __init__(self, updater_name, repository_mirrors):
    """
    <Purpose>
      Constructor.  Instantiating an updater object causes all the metadata
      files for the top-level roles to be read from disk, including the key
      and role information for the delegated targets of 'targets'.  The actual
      metadata for delegated roles is not loaded in __init__.  The metadata
      for these delegated roles, including nested delegated roles, are
      loaded, updated, and saved to the 'self.metadata' store by the target
      methods, like all_targets() and targets_of_role().
      
      The initial set of metadata files are provided by the software update
      system utilizing TUF.

        'tuf.formats.MIRRORDICT_SCHEMA'.  This dictionary holds information
        such as the directory containing the metadata and target files, the

      tuf.RepositoryError:
        If there is an error with the updater's repository files, such
        as a missing 'root.txt' file.

    <Side Effects>
      Th metadata files (e.g., 'root.txt', 'targets.txt') for the top-

    <Purpose>
      Update the metadata for 'metadata_role' if it has changed.  With the
      exception of the 'timestamp' role, all the top-level roles are updated
      by this function.  The 'timestamp' role is always downloaded from a mirror
      without first checking if it has been updated; it is updated in refresh()
      by calling _update_metadata('timestamp').  This function is also called for
      delegated role metadata, which are referenced by 'release'.
        
      If the metadata needs to be updated but an update cannot be obtained,
      this function will delete the file (with the exception of the root
      metadata, which never gets removed without a replacement).

      Due to the way in which metadata files are updated, it is expected that
      'referenced_metadata' is not out of date and trusted.  The refresh()
      method updates the top-level roles in 'timestamp -> release ->
      root -> targets' order.  For delegated metadata, the parent role is
      updated before the delegated role.  Taking into account that
      'referenced_metadata' is updated and verified before 'metadata_role',
      this function determines if 'metadata_role' has changed by checking
      the 'meta' field of the newly updated 'referenced_metadata'.

        The 'timestamp' metadata is always downloaded regardless.  In
        other words, it is updated by calling _update_metadata('timestamp')
        and not by this function.  The referenced metadata for 'release'
