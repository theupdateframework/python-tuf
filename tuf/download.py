<Purpose>
  Perform any file downloads and check their validity.  This means that the
  hash and length of a downloaded file has to match the hash and length
  supplied by the metadata of that file.  The downloaded file is technically a 
  file-like object that will automatically destroys itself once closed.  Note
  that the file-like object, 'tuf.util.TempFile', is returned by the
  'download_url_to_tempfileobj()' function.
