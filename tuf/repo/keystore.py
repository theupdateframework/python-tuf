<Started>
  March 28, 2012.  Based on a previous version of this module by Geremy Condra.

  See LICENSE for licensing information.

<Purpose>
  Help store private keys in encrypted files and provide functions to load and
  save a keystore database. The database contains all of the keys needed to
  sign a repository's Metadata files, such as 'root.txt' and 'release.txt'.

  Originally, this stored the keys in one file- we've changed that so that it
  instead encrypts them separately, naming them according to their keyid value.

  This changes the semantics of the system considerably- first, the 'fname'
  passed in was originally treated as a filename. We now treat it as the name
  of a directory.

  Secondly, it no longer makes sense to provide access to keys which do not
  match the given decryption key.

  Thirdly, the semantics of adding keys has changed. It does not make sense to 
  have only one key for the entire keystore, and as a result, we're requiring 
  that the password be set at the point where the key is added.

  The <keyid>.key files are encrypted with the AES-256-CTR-Mode symmetric key
  algorithm.  User passwords are strengthened with PBKDF2, currently set to
  100,000 passphrase iterations.  The previous evpy implementation used 1,000
  iterations.
