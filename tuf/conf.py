# 'tuf.conf.PBKDF2_ITERATIONS' should increase as CPU speeds increase, set here
# at 100,000 iterations by default (in 2013).  The repository maintainer may opt
# to modify the default setting according to their security needs and
# computational restrictions.  A strong user password is still important.
# Modifying the number of iterations will result in a new derived key+PBDKF2
# combination if the key is loaded and re-saved, overriding any previous
# iteration setting used by the old '<keyid>.key'.
