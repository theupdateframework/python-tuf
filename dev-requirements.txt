# This is a requirements file executed by pip and may be used during TUF
# development, and installation.  It can be executed as follows:
# $ pip install --requirement dev-requirements.txt
#
# pip install TUF (minimal install) in editable mode (i.e., setuptools
# "develop mode").  The current working directory must contain 'setup.py'.
--editable .

# Install PyNaCl for generation and verification of ed25519 keys and
# signatures.  It also includes protection against side-channel attacks.  NOTE:
# TUF only uses the pure Python implementation of ed25519 for signature
# verification.  PyNaCl is required for ed25519 key and signature generation
# with the TUF repository tools.  Also install cryptography for RSA key &
# signature support, and general-purpose cryptography needed by the repository
# tools.  Client must also install cryptography to verify RSASSA-PSS
# signatures.  The minimal install can only verify ed25519 signatures.  Pinned
