<Purpose>
  BUILD SOURCE DISTRIBUTION

  The following shell command generates a TUF source archive that can be
  distributed to other users.  The packaged source is saved to the 'dist'
  folder in the current directory.

  $ python setup.py sdist


  INSTALLATION OPTIONS

  pip - installing and managing Python packages (recommended):

  # Installing from Python Package Index (https://pypi.python.org/pypi).
  $ pip install tuf

  # Installing from local source archive.
  $ pip install <path to archive>

  # Or from the root directory of the unpacked archive.
  $ pip install .

  # Installing optional requirements (i.e., after installing tuf).
  # The 'tools' optional requirement is currently supported, which enables
  # fast and secure ed25519 key generation, and signature verification
  # computations with PyNaCl+libsodium.  General-purpose cryptography is also
  # provided.  'tools' is needed by the TUF repository tools.  Clients that
  # require verification of RSASSA-PSS signatures must also install tuf[tools].
  $ pip install tuf[tools]


  Alternate installation options:

  Navigate to the root directory of the unpacked archive and
  run one of the following shell commands:

  Install to the global site-packages directory.
  $ python setup.py install

  Install to the user site-packages directory.
  $ python setup.py install --user

  Install to a chosen directory.
  $ python setup.py install --home=<directory>


  Note: The last two installation options may require modification of
  Python's search path (i.e., 'sys.path') or updating an OS environment
  variable.  For example, installing to the user site-packages directory might
  result in the installation of TUF scripts to '~/.local/bin'.  The user may
  then be required to update his $PATH variable:
  $ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
