          This is a checklist for evaluating python-tuf maintainer accounts and permissions. This issue is automatically opened once a year.

          ### Tasks

          1. Update this list to include any new services
          2. Evaluate the accounts and permissions for each service on the list. Some rules of thumb:
             * Critical services should have a minimum of 3 _active_ maintainers/admins to prevent project lockout
             * Each additional maintainer/admin increases the risk of project compromise: for this reason permissions should be removed if they are no longer used
             * For services that are not frequently used, each maintainer/admin should check that they really are still able to authenticate to the service and confirm this in the comments
          3. Update MAINTAINERS.txt to reflect current permissions

          ### Critical services

          * [ ] **PyPI**: maintainer list is visible to everyone at https://pypi.org/project/tuf/
              * Only maintainers who do releases (+potentially org admins to prevent locking the project out)
          * [ ] **GitHub**: permissions visible to admins at https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/settings/access
              * "admin" permission: Only for maintainers and org admins who do project administration
              * "push/maintain" permission: Maintainers who actively approve and merge PRs (+admins)
              * "triage" permission: All contributors trusted to manage issues

          ### Other

          * [ ] **ReadTheDocs**: admin list is visible to everyone at https://readthedocs.org/projects/theupdateframework/
          * [ ] **Coveralls**: everyone with github "admin" permissions is a Coveralls admin: https://coveralls.io/github/theupdateframework/python-tuf
