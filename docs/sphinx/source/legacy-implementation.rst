=====================

.. note:: The legacy implementation, with
   `tuf/client/updater.py <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/client/updater.py>`_ implementing the detailed
   client workflow and `tuf/repository_tool.py <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tuf/repository_tool.py>`_
   providing a high-level interface for repository operations, is in use in production systems, but is `no longer
   being actively worked on <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/docs/adr/0002-pre-1-0-deprecation-strategy.md>`_.
