Welcome to TUF's documentation!
===============================

This is the documentation of the **reference implementation** of
`The Update Framework (TUF) <https://theupdateframework.github.io/>`_.

The reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstration
for those working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, or
update systems. It is written in Python and intended to conform to version 1.0 of the
`TUF specification <https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/>`_.
