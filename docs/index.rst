TUF Developer Documentation
===========================

This documentation provides essential information for those developing software
with the `Python reference implementation of The Update Framework (TUF)
<https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf>`_.

The reference implementation provides easy-to-use components for Python
developers but also aims to be a readable guide and demonstration for those
working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, or update
systems.
