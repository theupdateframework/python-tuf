# Security Issues and Bugs

Security issues can be reported to maintainers [privately via GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability):

- [**Report new vulnerability**](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/security/advisories/new)

Please do not use the GitHub issue tracker to submit vulnerability reports. The issue tracker is intended for bug reports and to make feature requests. Major feature requests, such as design changes to the specification, should be proposed via a [TUF Augmentation Proposal](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/#tuf-augmentation-proposal-tap-support) (TAP).
